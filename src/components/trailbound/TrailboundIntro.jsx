                Trailbound is a self-created outdoor lifestyle brand that
                combines functionality and style, offering durable gear designed
                for both adventure and everyday wear.

                For this assignment, I developed the brand entirely from scratch
                â€” including the visual identity, brand guidelines, and a fully
                designed Shopify e-commerce website. My goal was to build a
                brand that feels authentic, consistent, and engaging, while
                showing how design can connect lifestyle storytelling with
                digital retail.
